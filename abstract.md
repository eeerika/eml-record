There is a need among those researching kelp forests in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC) to have a data set that brings together information on ocean nutrients, depth, sea surface temperature, seafloor habitat, kelp area, and kelp biomass. This project creates that data set along with a data pipeline that allows researchers to easily add their own observations or work with the original data sets directly. This project also addresses a need in the kelp aquaculture community for an analysis of giant kelp habitat suitability in the SBC to compare industry site assessments to. Using the maximum entropy species distribution modeling technique, heat maps of relative habitat suitability were created that can be compared to other analyses and have the potential to guide siting future research and cultivation projects. Finally, to aid in communicating this project to a broader audience in the future this project will provide the framework for an interactive web application that can be built upon by future stewards of the project.
